# For all git commit messages

* Use the normal git commit message conventions, such as:
  * Have a short introduction that is limited to a single line
  * Have a blank line after the introduction line
  * Have a blank line between all paragraphs

* Keep all lines <75 characters

# For all source code

* Ensure that no lines end in whitespace
* Ensure that blank lines are actually zero characters long (i.e.,
  they do not end in whitespace)
* Try to keep source code lines <=75 characters long
